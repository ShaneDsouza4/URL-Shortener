URL Shortener

- Design a URL Shortener Service, that takes a valid URL and returns a shortened URL, redirecting the user to the previously provided URL. Similar to bitly.
- Also keep track of total visits/clicks on the URL.

Routes:
1. Generate new URL and return the shortened URL in format example.com/random-id
Method: POST
Route: /URL


2. Redirect user to original URL
Method: GET
Route: /:id

3. Return the clicks for provided short id
Method: GET
Route: /URL/analytics/:id
